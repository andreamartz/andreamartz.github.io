      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This email newsletter was designed and built collaboratively by Amy McGowan and Andrea Martz. We built it in response
        to an assignment during Cohort 4 of <a href="https://www.momscan.co/">Moms Can Code School</a> to create a single issue
        of an email newsletter.
      </p>
      <img src="img/email-newsletter-image-wide.png" alt="desktop computer screen showing the email newsletter">
      <p>Our newsletter was designed for a fictional community food pantry. The purpose of the newsletter is to engage
        community members and show them the ways they can make a difference for their neighbors in need.
      </p>
      <p>Andrea Martz independently built this page to tell the story of how our project came to life.

      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>Amy and I did not know each other before we worked together on this project, but it was such a pleasure working
        with her on this project!</p>
      <p>We made all process, design, and coding decisions jointly, and we built the page mostly through pair programming.
        We did divide some of the work, however. Here are some things we did separately:</p>

            <h2>Design: Layout</h2>
            <p>We wanted to have an attractive and streamlined layout for our content. With this in mind, we researched several real
            email newsletters to find inspiration. The newsletter below from Charity: Water inspired the creation of our wireframe.</p>

            <h2>Design: Style</h2>
            <p>All fonts and icons were chosen to give a modern, yet simple look to keep the focus on the message of the newsletter.
            The primary font used was Cuprum, but other sans serif fonts were also used for slight variation.</p>
            <p>We chose the colors with our theme and audience in mind from the palettes at Colorhunt (https://colorhunt.co/)</p>
            <div>
              <!-- Color this div #57A99A and make it a horizontal rectangle -->
            </div>
            <div>
              <!-- Color this div #D1EECC and use border-radius to make it a circle -->
            </div>
            <p>Green evokes thoughts of health, growth, and generosity and makes us feel peaceful.</p>
            <div>
              <!-- Color this div #76DBD1 and use border-radius to make it a circle -->
            </div>
            <p>Blue brings to mind trust, strength, stability, and dependability.  We chose a greenish blue since green is an important 
              color for our message.</p>
            <p>Next, we found an image of a toddler holding a bowl of berries and wearing a light bluish green shirt. That seemed like
              the perfect banner image. We flipped the image horizontally using Canva to show the child facing inward toward the
              content.</p>

            <p>We created a style guide for our color, font, and icon choice to achieve a harmonious look throughout.</p>

            <h2>Building the Newsletter</h2>
            <p>Amy and I mostly did pair programming to build the newsletter. This was the first project either of us had built
              independently, so we had a lot of Googling to do.</p>
            <p>I came to appreciate that there are many differences between HTML/CSS for email vs. for web development. Because email
            clients all display email in different ways, email developers often find themselves using HTML and CSS elements and
            practices not seen in web development since the late 1990s.</p>
            <p>Among the biggest differences are these:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Email developers must use the otherwise antiquated HTML table element to structure the layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Many common email clients do not support embedded video
              </li>
              <li>
                HEX colors must be fully specified; that is the three character shortcut is not supported by all email clients.
              </li>
              <li>
                Many fonts are not supported in email. To be safe, it’s best to use web safe fonts only.
              </li>
              <li>
                Emails must be coded using inline CSS instead of linking a separate file in the head.
              </li>
              <li>
                CSS shorthand should not be used.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the page was built, we ran email tests to Yahoo and Gmail addresses using 
              <a href="https://www.emailonacid.com/email-testing/">Email on Acid</a>.

            <h2>Things I Learned</h2>
            <p>I learned more about web and email design and development than I can reasonably list here, but these are the highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I learned all the ways that coding an email newsletter differs from creating a static webpage.
              </li>
              <li>
                I pair programmed with someone remotely for the first time. Amy and I had different approaches to the coding, and it
                was a good reminder that we all solve problems differently.
              </li>
              <li>
                I learned what Figma is used for and how to create mockups using it. Although Amy did all of the design work in
                Figma, I was able to create a copy of it and experiment with how to make my own changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                This was a good test, and expansion, of my newly formed Git and GitHub skills. I hosted our project repo and
                reviewed and merged all of the pull requests.
              </li>

            <p>There are some improvements I would like to make to this newsletter that we were either unaware of or unable to accomplish when we

                <ul>

            <p>This email newsletter was designed and built collaboratively by Amy McGowan and Andrea Martz. The project was
              completed in response to an assignment during Cohort 4 of Moms Can Code School (https://www.momscan.co/) to
              create a single issue of an email newsletter.</p>         
            <p>Our newsletter was designed for a fictional community food pantry. The purpose of the newsletter is to engage 
              community members and show them the ways they can make a difference for their neighbors in need.</p>
            <p>This page tells the story of how our project came to life.</p>
